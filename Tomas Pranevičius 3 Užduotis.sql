/*SQL Home Task
The output of the task should be provided queries. If you can, you could also provide the output
of the query result or test scenarios.
Duration of the task working remotely is 1.5 h. First 0.5 h should be spent for data upload to the
DB. 1 hour should be spent for writing the queries. It is completely OK not to finish all tasks
â€“ quality is more important than quantity!
You should use default.sandbox_activations table/ file
(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wuh6ZbBbeh1Jkk_jlOY76-kDVcipsU6T/view?usp=sharing),
where you can get information about the base of the prepaid clients.
Before starting the task, you should download PostgreSQL https://www.postgresql.org/download/
Upload sandbox_activations.csv file into the DB.
Main info about the columns of a prepaid customer base:
-- account_id - unique SIM / Client ID
-- msisdn - phone number of the client
-- activation_date - service activation date
-- deletion_date - service deactivation date
-- status - the newest/current status of the service/client
-- imei_a - unique phone/device ID (IMEI).
-- device_brand - Phone brand
-- device_model - Phone model
-- device_type - Phone type

-- imei_end_dt - the date when new other msisdn reused the phone.*/
